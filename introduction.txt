The file "The regression tree model of economic values of rice.py" is a script file that analyzes the relationship between the 
biological traits and economic value of different varieties of rice through the regression tree algorithm based on the data in workbook_1_english.xlsx

The "workbook_1.xlsx" is the source data, which is provided by the "Rice Breeding Decision Support System" database constructed by the Agricultural 
Information Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science. 

The script file reads in the "workbook_1.xlsx" and outputs a pdf file "_name_of_economic_value regression tree(max_depth=_a_integer_from_2_to_8)".
When execute the script, please follow the instruction popped in the console. 

The "biological traits" here includes following columns in "workbook_1.xlsx":
	1000*number of effective panicle per chinese acre (1 chinese acre = 667 square meters), x[0] in the output regression tree	
	plant height, x[1] in the output regression tree;
	panicle length, x[2] in the output regression tree;
	total number of grains per panicle, x[3] in the output regression tree;	
	number of filled grains per panicle, x[4] in the output regression tree; 	
	percentage of filled grains	weight per 1000 grains, x[5] in the output regression tree;	
	length of grain, x[6];
	length/width of each grain, x[7] in the output regression tree;
i.e., the yellow-shaded region of the "data" worksheet of "workbook_1.xlsx". 

The "economic values" here includes following columns in "workbook_1.xlsx":
	brown rice rate: the percentage of grain that can be processed to brown rice;
	milled rice rate: the percentage of grain that can be processed to milled rice;	
	head rice rate: the percentage of grain that can be processed to head rice;
	chalkiness rate: the percentage of the number of grains with chalkiness over total number of grains;
	chalkiness: the percentage of  area of the chalky region over the total projection of the grain's area;
	adhesiveness: when the rice grain melts into paste, the paste has ductility. The adhesiveness is the maximum length that the paste can extend until it breaks into two parts;
	percentage of amylose;	
	full growth peroid;	
	yield (kg per chinese acre, 1 chinese acre = 667 square meter); 
i.e., the blue-shaded region of the "data" worksheet of "workbook_1.xlsx".
